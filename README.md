# AlMech
Those mechanisms are for aluminum combustion in different oxidizing environments considering both homogeneous and heterogeneous chemical reactions.
The format has been tested for OpenSMOKE and ANSYS@Chemkin Pro.
Note: although thoese three files can be written in one file, I prefer to use three different mechanisms, in order to reduce potential computaional cost caused by increasing number of species and reactions.
